## TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

I’ve loved learning, problem solving, and creating things for as long as I can remember. I really wanted to keep developing my skills in that area,
which I did by geting into the music scene and becoming a technical arts director.
I was in that role for 4+ years and loved every second of it.

From my experince there I wanted to shift into more a more prominent problem solving role and decided to learn how to code and have loved it ever since.

I love Faith Family Fitness

## Biggest weakness

self confidence. sometimes it can be a great thing in that I think i can figure most things out on my own.
but it can be a detriment sometimes also when i dont ask for help.
asking for help is something i have been working on and definitely seeing the benefits and becoming a part of my learning process

## Why do you want to work here?

I know everyone propabaly says this. But I really want to expound on WHY!

Everyone probably says. "I really just want to help people!!"

And, Yes! Yes I do want to help people!!

But let me tell you why...

I want to be a part of helping change people’s entire lives.
Not only from a financial perspective, but also their, personal lives, marriage, job, and their spiritual life.
I believe that becoming finacially free is a stepping stone to becoming a more developed human being.

Part of what makes Dave Ramsey's method so effective, is it truly gives people hope!
Not just in that they can infact become debt free, but more so HOPE IN THEMSELVES.
I believe that self confidence is key overcoming adversity and achieving goals.
And when you smash a huge goal like getting out of THOUSANDS of dollars of debt, you prove to yourself that
"You CAN overcome."
"You CAN achieve goals"

This trickles down into your personal life

The top two arguments that people have in marriage are Kids and finances.
when you are debt free, have a safty net, and controlled spending, and have a plan for retirement, there is no longer any need to worry about finances.
You have it all under control.
Just based on math, this elemenates 1/2 of the arguments. which will no doubt make your marriage better.

It also trickles down into your job.
You are no longer WORKING for a paycheck to just stay afloat.
You are PERFORMING and loving what you do and able to focus on the difference you are making.

That is WHY I want to work at Ramsey Solutions.

## Tell us about applications you've worked on

I have worked on several different applications.

1. TIEME NDO
   A fully finctional CRM for rual farmers based out of Ghana africa.
   I chose to work on this project for some of the same reasons above. TO HELP People have hope!

This CRM is tailored towards helping farmers be able to easily track
the crops they have in inventory, tools of the trade, loan amounts,
transactions they have made and,
number of installments they have, and clients they sell their crops to.

This CRM aims to empower farmers to be entrepreneurs and start small farming businesses to support their families.
We used React and Redux for UI and state management.
We used Java for our backend and database management.

I started from scratch and built beautiful new Front end UI with a great User experience.
I utilized styled components and react bootstrap for styling framworks.

• Lambda Team Builder helps with product ideation and project curation.
• As an administrator you can log into the app and see a list of products in a grid format so that you can visualize all products for a build week.
(build week is where lambda students assemble in teams of 3-5 to use their new knowledge to build a new application.
Evey build week is comprised of 20+ cohorts with a minimum of 300 students per build week)
• You can create a new product with the fields Product Name & Product Description, so that you can create a new project for students to join.
• You can add an enumerable amount of roles to a product idea and let users sign up to a role they want to handle.
• We as a team used React for Frontend and Node.js for backend.
