How do you improve?

==> Devise a plan for solving problems <==

==> Master common problem solving patters <==


--> PROBLEM SOLVING STRATS <--
1. Understand the problem
    a. Can you restate the problem in your own words
    b. What are the inputs that go into the problem
    c. What are the outputs that should be returned from the problem
    d. Can the outputs be determined by the inputs (do you have enough information to solve the problem)
    e. How should I lable the important pieces of data that are apart of the problem

2. Explore Concrete Examples
    a. Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    b. Examples also provide saity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
    c. Start with simple examples (write it down!)
    d. Progress to more complex examples
    e. Explore examples with empty inputs
    f. Explore examples with invalid inputs

3. Break it down
    a. Explicitly write down the steps you need to take. (Psudo Code)

4. Solve / Simplify
    a. Solve the problem, if you cant, SOLVE a simpler problem
    b. Find the core difficulty in the thing you are trying to do --> Temporarily ignore that difficulty --> write a simplified solution --> incorperate that difficulty back in.

5. Look Back / Refactor
    a. Can you check the result
    b. Can you dirive the result differently
    c. Can you understand it at a glance
    d. Can you use the method or result for some other problem
    e. Can you improve the performance of your solution
    f. Can you think of other ways to refactor
