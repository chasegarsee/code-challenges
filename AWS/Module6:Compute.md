Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server in the cloud. An AMI includes:

A template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating system or an application server with applications)
Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it is launched

[1] Why is AWS more economical than traditional data center for applications with varying compute workloads?
==>[a] Amazon EC2 instances can be launched on-demand.

[2] If your project requires monthy reports that iterate through vary large amounts of data, which Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) purchasing option should you consider?
==>[a] Scheduled Reserved Instances

[3] What is included in Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
==>[a] A template for the root volume for the instance
==>[b] Launch Permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
==>[c] A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.

[4] Which Amazon Elasic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) feature ensures you instances will not share a physical host with instances from any other AWS customer?
==>[a] Dedicated Instances

[5] What is a serverless compute service in AWS
==>[a] AWS Lambda

[6] What is the service provided by AWS that nables developers to easily deploy and manage applications in the cloud.
==>[a] AWS Elastic Beanstalk

[7] Your web applications needs four instanves to support steady traffic all the time. on the last day of the month, the traffic triples. what is the most cost-effective way to handle this pattern?
==>[a] 4 Reserved / 8 on demand.

[8] Containers are a full OS
==>[a] false

[9] What Amazon EC2 option is best for long-term workloads with predictable usage patterns
==>[a] Reserved instances

[10] What must be specified when launching a new Amazon Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) Windows instance
==>[a] Amazon EC2 instance type
==>[b] Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
